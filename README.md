# saph_pico_temperature

Small project to learn how to use the Pi Pico, i.e. an ARM Cortex M0+ device as well as CMake and how to build things in general with it.
Because I'm obsessed with making my life difficult, it aims to incorporates the ceedling testing framework to use unity and CMock. This is done in the form of some symlinks to necessary source and header files of the installed gem. 

There are some CMake targets that are not meant to work in their current configuration, but are mainly there to improve the convenience of developing this within CLion. 

## Targeted devices of this project:

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Bosch BME280
- Some OLED screen i haven't decided on.

## How to use/import
TBA
